# Business Analysis Case Study – Digital Platform for Academic, Administrative, and Franchise Operations

This project demonstrates practical Business Analysis work applied to the development of a custom digital platform used across multiple education units. It includes process mapping, requirements definition, workflow automation, and operational improvements that supported scalability and reduced manual workload.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze existing operational workflows (AS‑IS), identify inefficiencies, and design improved processes (TO‑BE) to support the development of a web‑based platform for academic, administrative, and financial operations.

The platform centralized student data, automated academic workflows, and enabled multi‑unit scalability for franchise operations.

## 🧩 Key Business Analysis Activities

### **1. Process Mapping**
- Mapped AS‑IS workflows across academic delivery, customer service, sales, procurement, and franchise operations  
- Designed TO‑BE processes to reduce manual work and improve consistency  
- Identified bottlenecks, redundancies, and opportunities for automation  

### **2. Requirements Gathering**
- Collected business needs through observation, interviews, and operational analysis  
- Defined functional and non‑functional requirements for the platform  
- Documented user stories, acceptance criteria, and system behaviors  

### **3. Workflow Automation**
- Automated exercises, revision activities, assessments, and learning‑sequence progression using rule‑based logic  
- Reduced manual workload by approximately 70%  
- Improved accuracy and consistency in academic operations  

### **4. Data & System Structure**
- Centralized student records, scheduling, contracts, and financial workflows  
- Supported multi‑unit scalability with isolated franchise data  
- Managed VPS deployments, backups, and database maintenance
